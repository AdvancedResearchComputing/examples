OpenFOAM v2406 

This is a simple incompressible Fluid example provided with the installation. The necessary data is copied and the blockMeshDict and decomposeParDict files for parallelization are provided here. This example is designed to run with 4 processes in parallel; thus the job requests 4 CPU processors (aka “cores” or “chips”).

Alternatively, this example can be run in an interactive job. See the attached documentation `desktop.pdf` for running this example with the Desktop App on the owl cluster.
