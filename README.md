# examples
Usage examples for computing resources offered by Advanced Research Computing at Virginia Tech (https://www.arc.vt.edu). All examples can be run with
`sbatch -Ayourallocation software_system.sh`
where 
- `yourallocation` is the allocation associated with your research project or class 
- `software_system.sh` is the submission script (e.g., `openblas_tinkercliffs_rome.sh`)

Most examples here were put together by former ARC Computational Scientist John Burkardt (see, e.g., https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/) and later updated to the Slurm scheduler and newer clusters.
